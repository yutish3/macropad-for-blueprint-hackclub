completed the top part and fixed the wireing of the pcb

one thing that i messed up is that i wasnt journelling the whole thing and was pretty inconsistent i will keep that in mind for my next one

Made the pcb and the bottom box
Made the pcb and the box I will make the top lid and the firm ware later
My idea for firmware is so that it can work as a normal macropad and in oled screen you can play animations or play doom (will work by running it on your device which is connected to macropad)
